Unlike other voice cloning methods, RVC does not require a large amount of training data from the target speaker. This makes it a more versatile and efficient approach to voice cloning.
Traditional voice conversion techniques typically rely on statistical models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) or Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), to learn the mapping between the source and target voices.</description></item><item><title>Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC)</title><link>https://kirawat.me/garden/retrieval-based-voice-conversion-rvc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 17:01:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://kirawat.me/garden/retrieval-based-voice-conversion-rvc/</guid><description>Retrieval-based voice conversion (RVC) is a method of voice cloning that uses a pre-trained model to retrieve and combine segments of speech from a source speaker to synthesize the voice of a target speaker.

Quality of your microphone and cable uses can impact the real-time voice conversion result.
VC Client DirectML or CUDA? TLDR; If you have NVIDIA GPUs, go for CUDA. If you have AMD or INTEL ARC GPUs, go for DirectML. For macOS, there is only one version.</description></item><item><title>Voice Changing with Machine Learning</title><link>https://kirawat.me/garden/voice-changing-with-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 21:42:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://kirawat.me/garden/voice-changing-with-machine-learning/</guid><description>Tools VC Client: This is a client software for performing real-time voice conversion using various Voice Conversion (VC) AI.
