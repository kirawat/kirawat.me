<span class=tooltip>16 Dec 2023 17:25:54 PM (+07:00)</span></div></div></div></div><div class=content><p>I can&rsquo;t remember the first time I&rsquo;ve heard about the &ldquo;digital garden&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s intrigued me. I was deep in thought about the ways to archive information and knowledge for quite sometime, and I believe it&rsquo;s how I ended up stumped upon an article mention about the digital garden.</p><p>It does seem to be similar to many form of the way to keep knowledge base out there, such as blog, wiki, or commonplace book. What making it differences from those?</p><h2 id=what-is-a-digital-garden>What is a Digital Garden?</h2><p>According to Danielle Messler, the author of a blog post <a href=https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden target=_blank>&ldquo;What is a digital garden?&rdquo;</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A digital garden is your corner of the internet—a place for you to explore and write about what interests you, just because it interests you. Without worrying about if it&rsquo;s in your niche. Without worrying whether or not your audience will like it. Without the pressure of having all the answers wrapped up in one neat post.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:1><a href=..//#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>For Anne-Laure Le Cunff, founder of Ness Labs, digital garden is &ldquo;an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=..//#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes."<sup id=fnref1:2><a href=..//#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>It just a matter of collecting knowledge and put them out there to the public, in any stage, whether it&rsquo;s just a heading, just one line of paragraph, one word, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be completed right away. Like how you plant a seed in the ground. Then you comes back to tend it with further knowledge you have gathered since then, until its grow into a fruitful content.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The garden metaphor is particularly apt: taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits). On the surface, it&rsquo;s a repetitive process. You need consistency and patience. But each day tending to your &lsquo;mind garden&rsquo; is different: discovering a new learning strategy, having a eureka moment, connecting the dots between two authors, getting involved in a lively conversation with an expert.&rdquo; — Anne-Laure Le Cunff<sup id=fnref:3><a href=..//#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s great in a way of perfectionist me, who have problem at getting things out there until it&rsquo;s up to my standard. Even if it&rsquo;s reach my standard at a time, I would have thought of the ways to keep improving it. It&rsquo;s a never ending process of creating and tweaking. That&rsquo;s why the idea of digital garden is resonated well with me.</p><p>The concept of digital garden is like going back to the basic of the old internet era, since when The Web was created, as Maggie Appleton mentioned in her post; <a href=https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web target=_blank>&ldquo;Metaphors We Web By&rdquo;</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s original pitch for The Web, he described it as a &ldquo;non-linear text system&rdquo; for notes. It was designed for scientific researchers and academics to pass around documents that would otherwise be printed on physical paper. The point of the web was to mimic long, text-based, paper documents, but simply make them easier to move around.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:4><a href=..//#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Daniel Sieger also posted on his blog post <a href=https://danielsieger.com/blog/2021/05/30/digital-gardens.html target=_blank>“Digital Gardens. Seriously?”</a> agreed that “digital gardens are clearly reminiscent of the quirky personal websites of the early web.”<sup id=fnref:5><a href=..//#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> He also explained that “digital gardens stimulate the idea to create personalized content that is built to last and independent of locked-down third-party platforms.”<sup id=fnref1:5><a href=..//#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p><p>What he meant by that is that most of the modern web development are store content in database form, hosting on a rented remote server. Website are much more complex than what it used to be. In the early day it was just HTML files hosting in the server. To backup and migrates them to another server is just to copy files and folder and then paste it to another location.</p><p>In <a href=https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/ target=_blank>&ldquo;How the Blog Broke the Web&rdquo;</a>, Amy Hoy wrote about the early days of the Internet:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dates didn&rsquo;t matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older content remained in view, too, because the dominant metaphor was table of contents rather than diary entry. Everyone with a homepage became a de facto amateur reference librarian.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:6><a href=..//#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote class=callout-note><div class=callout-title>Note</div><p>The concept of the digital garden is reminiscing the way programming/coding work. Perhaps, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s gain popularity among those?</p></blockquote><p>Anne-Laure Le Cunff writes down her raw thoughts in a note-taking app, use digital garden to &ldquo;conntect early-stage ideas, collect evergreen notes, and plat the seeds for more ambitious work.&rdquo; Then publish longer essays on her blog.<sup id=fnref:7><a href=..//#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your note-taking app, &mldr; can be used for collating snippets, ideas, and raw thinking. Use it to seed your garden and connect the dots. Once you have managed to articulate a new idea (new to you at least), write down a few more structured sentences, and add it to your digital garden as an evergreen note. You can stop here, but for people who have a proper blog or a newsletter, you may want to publish longer essays there.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref1:3><a href=..//#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Digital gardens can certainly be use to store and organize information in a way that resonates with you, building a personalized knowledge base, but the main point of it is to prioritize meaningful connections and personal interpretation over your collection of knowledge. It&rsquo;s not just about saving facts, but it&rsquo;s about tracking and understanding your intellectual journey.</p><h2 id=growth-stages>Growth Stages</h2><p>There is some concern about contents in the digital garden as well, and that’s false information. As the contents are plants at a very early stage, such information aren’t completed. The factual of such information might not be verified. Those who stumped upon such information, likely from search engines, might not understand that, and picked up on the uncompleted content.</p><p>However, as explained by Daniel:</p><blockquote><p>“The raw material inevitably contains factual errors. This can, however, be mitigated to some extent by indicating the maturity and reliability of the content.”<sup id=fnref2:5><a href=..//#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Maggie Appleton metaphor and categorizes her content in three different growth stage; seedling, budding, and evergreen.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Seedlings</strong> are ideas that just started. They are rough, unrefined, and need more time to grow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buddings</strong> are ideas that has been revised and worked on a bit. They&rsquo;re starting to grow, but still need refinement</p></li><li><p><strong>Evergreens</strong> are ideas that has been invested significant time into. They are refined, edited, and won&rsquo;t significantly change - aside from the occasional trimming.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://notes.nitinpai.in/ target=_blank>Nitin Pai</a> use brewing coffee analogy to indicate the stage of his notes into 5 non-linear levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bean</strong> implies that it is a new, undeveloped idea.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brewing</strong> is when he started working on it, but do not think it is ready for sampling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Brewed</strong> is when he think the content has finished brewing. Though, he might decide that it needs some more brewing at later stage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overbrewed</strong> is when he revise and modify a note what he had previously considered brewed because he think it will improve, but he might have make things worse.</p></li><li><p><strong>In-the-sink</strong> is when he discarded the note, either because it is ruined, past the expiry date, is a royal mass or stinks.</p></li></ul><h2 id=examples-of-the-digital-garden>Examples of the Digital Garden</h2><ul><li><a href=https://maggieappleton.com/ target=_blank>https://maggieappleton.com/</a></li><li><a href=https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/ target=_blank>https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/</a></li><li><a href=https://garden.timrodenbroeker.de/ target=_blank>https://garden.timrodenbroeker.de/</a></li><li><a href=https://notes.nitinpai.in/ target=_blank>https://notes.nitinpai.in/</a></li></ul><h2 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href=https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history target=_blank>A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden</a> by Maggie Appleton</li><li><a href=https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/ target=_blank>How the Blog Broke the Web</a> by Amy Hoy</li><li><a href=https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public target=_blank>Learn in Public</a> by Shawn Wang</li><li><a href=https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/ target=_blank>Digital Garden Terms of Service</a> by Shawn Wang</li><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/ target=_blank>r/DigitalGardens</a> community on Reddit</li></ul><h2 id=related-notes>Related Notes</h2><ul><li><a href=../how-to-use-obsidian-with-hugo>How to use Obsidian with Hugo</a></li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Messler, Danielle. <a href=https://www.thunknotes.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-garden target=_blank>&ldquo;What is a digital garden?&rdquo;</a> <em>Trunk Notes</em>.
