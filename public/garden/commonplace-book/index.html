London &mldr; did not take creative writing or composition courses? They copied very carefully passages from classic literature and then tried to write the same passage again from memory without looking at the model. They used their own words when needed, but tried to sound like the original author as much as possible.

They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="callout quote"><div class=title>IndieWeb</div><p></p>An early how-to book entitled <em>A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books</em> (1706) was written by philosopher John Locke in which he provided techniques for entering proverbs, quotations, ideas, and formulating speeches.
