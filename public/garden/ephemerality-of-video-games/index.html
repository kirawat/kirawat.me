While the immediate satisfaction of completing a challenging task is undeniable, the knowledge that the game will eventually be faded away can lead to a sense of impermanence. However, this ephemerality can also be seen as a positive, encouraging players to focus on the journey and enjoyment of the present moment, rather than clinging to the outcome.</p><h2 id=why-do-we-play-video-games>Why do we play video games?</h2><p>The reasons why people play video games are as diverse and individual as the players themselves ranging from pure entertainment and escapism to social connection and even cognitive improvement. The motivations can vary depending on the person, the specific game, and the context in which the game is played.</p><p>Consider it like to read books or watch movies, we do it for the story and whatever knowledge we can learn from it. If you don&rsquo;t enjoy that particular story, then there really is no point in finished it. If you feel like you need to force yourself to finished it, it probably from being a <a href=../ephemerality-of-video-games/#completionists>completionist</a>.</p><p>Games aren&rsquo;t as fun as the games of old. Maybe because the <a class=external-link href=https://www.xda-developers.com/pc-gaming-more-fun-20-years-ago/ target=_blank>shifted toward next-gen graphics rather than the actual enjoyment of the games</a>.</p><h2 id=the-life-of-live-service-games>The Life of Live Service Games</h2><p>Live service games won’t last forever. Lots of mobile games are free to play, and they’re not possible to archives them all for the future generation. The best we could do is to records everything we could about each of them like how we keep record of the historical events that came and gone. Takes screenshots and record gameplay as you play through to remember the moment, like how you record your moment as you travel through the foreign countries.</p><p>As games are eventually shutdown, the gameplay experience, progress, and achievements within then become ephemeral, potentially leading to reflection on the value of the experience later on in your life.</p><p>The value of playing a game lies not just in the final outcome, but in the experience itself. The enjoyment of exploration, challenge, discovery, and personal growth can be valuable even after completed the game.</p><hr><p>Free to play games monetisation is like buffet. Its expected that some would pay more for the game to offset those who play the game completely free without spending.</p><p>Some people enjoy revisiting games they loved from their childhood or past experiences.</p><p>There is no official way to backup save file from Nintendo Switch locally. Why do you need to keep save files? A prove of your own achievement?</p><p>Sometimes, there is just no choice to play certain games that are exclusive to particular console legally. Eventually, the game won&rsquo;t be playable in the future generation of console. Then, you just have to wait for it to be remaster so you can buy it again just to play and relives the experience. Well, that is pretty much how the movies moved their format from VHS to Blu-ray, and from SD to 4K.</p><hr><h2 id=type-of-player>Type of Player</h2><h3 id=completionists>Completionists</h3><p>Players who enjoy the satisfaction of collecting items, completing challenges, and unlocking all the content in a game are often referred to as completionists or achievement hunters.</p><p>They are driven by a desire to master the game and exhaust all its possibilities. This type of player typically driven by a sense of internal satisfaction, enjoying the process of collecting and completing tasks. They explore every corner of the game and leave no stone unturned. They have a strong desire to complete everything and don&rsquo;t like leaving things unfinished. Completing everything in a game can be a huge personal achievement.</p><p>Sharing achievements online or within gaming communities can bring a sense of pride and recognition. Completionist runs are often admired for their dedication and skill.</p><p>However, the pressure to complete everything can lead to burnout and frustration, and loss enjoyment of the game.</p></div></article><aside class=sidebar-r></aside></div><div class=comments><div class=giscus></div></div></div></main><footer><div class=container><div class=copyright>© 2024 Kirawat Sahasewiyon.</div><div class=spacer></div><span class=license>&nbsp;Content licensed <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY-NC 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.4/moment.min.js></script>
